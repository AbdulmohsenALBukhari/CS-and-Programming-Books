#### P/s: Sorry for a longtime I cannot update the new books because I have some other stuff to do. However, in this year - 2019 I will be back and this responsitory will have more free programming books. Also, I will concentrate on creating some responsitories about what I have learnt about JavaScript and some other web programming languages. By the way, all of these books above just available in English.

####      Some of these books on this responsitory have the copyright of the authors. If you want to support them, buy their books to read and learn.
